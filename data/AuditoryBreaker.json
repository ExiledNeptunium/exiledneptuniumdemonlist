    "opinion": "Easy remake of Sonic Wave, and is one of only two remakes of Sonic Wave that I think even look decent. I beat this fairly quickly (despite a 96% death) and enjoyed it a lot. I genuinely thought for a period of time that this was harder than Sonic Wave and I know better than that now. But the dual in the 2nd wave is harder than the one in Sonic Wave and that makes me upset to this day.",
