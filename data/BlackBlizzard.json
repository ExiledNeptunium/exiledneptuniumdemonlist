    "opinion": "A classic and unique extreme demon that I unfortunately dislike because of my experience with it. The drop to 100 is a fun run but it was just never as good as other people said it was. The predrop and 2nd cube were ATROCIOUS to play and made up most of Black Blizzard's difficulty. I'm glad that I beat this before 2.2 because otherwise I would've been in for a terrible time with the new physics.",
