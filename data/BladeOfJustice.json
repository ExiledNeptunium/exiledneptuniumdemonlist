    "opinion": "Kind of not the best level?? The beginning is very boring to play but is very consistent. The wave is super awkward to learn, and then everything is pretty straight forward until the 50 dual, which is one of the most inconsistent and awkward parts in any level I have ever played. After that, the gameplay's consistent but hard.",
