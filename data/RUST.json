    "opinion": "My hardest at the time of completion, and my worst experience in GD to date. This level has really bad balancing, with the predrop being by far the hardest part, and even with a double click being completely bugged when I beat it. This level was terrible on my mental health when I was actively trying to complete it as I had set a deadline on myself which turned out to make my experience with this level SOOOO much worse. This level is basically chokepoint carried, and 99/100 attempts would just end to a chokepoint or some random bullshit in the predrop.",
