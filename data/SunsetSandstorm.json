    "opinion": "One of the first levels I really took an interest in beating when I came back to GD. This level is like beating two extreme demons back to back, as the first cube is about half the difficulty and the rest of the level is the other half. Everything past the first cube is really fun to play and some of the most enjoyable gameplay in a level I've ever seen; however, the first cube's gameplay is relentless (REFERENCE) and not that fun to play, and it can get boring considerably often.",
